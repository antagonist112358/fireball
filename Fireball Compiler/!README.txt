Don't bother making any changes to the compiler yet!

I was originally going to rewrite the compiler in scratch in Nemerle, but realized this was going to be a huge effort. In the end it would probably not be worth it because the final Fireball compiler should be written in, well... Fireball itself!

The code here is just what I had managed to get done with the Nemerle from-scratch compiler. Some of this might be useful in the bootstrapping compiler, but most of it I imagine will get thrown away.
