// This test shows how a variable can be created with the

// This was a bug exposed by Digger, as we incorrectly tried to
// do some work ahead of time during the resolution process
// (ie, we created LocalVariableReferences for the int variable `Ghost', 
// which stopped `Ghost' from being useful as a type afterwards
